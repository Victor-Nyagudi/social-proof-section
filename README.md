## Overview

### The challenge

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

## My process

I started with the HTML while observing the desktop version then wrote the CSS for the mobile version and 
slowly expanded from there. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I knew about the social proof section of a website, but I hadn't made one yet, so this gave me some practice
on that front. 

### Continued development

Completed this in the 4-6 hour window I set for myself, so I'm happy with that. Had a bit of disruption in there somewhere, but nothing too serious. 

This is the last of the "newbie" challenges, so I'll be moving to the "junior" ones from now on, God-willing. 
Hoping to get some JavaScript practice in there somewhere as well.

Here's to greater things!
